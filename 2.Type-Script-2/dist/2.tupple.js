//tupple is an array with some conditions
/*
when we can use tuples
      when
    -the number of elements in an array is fixed,
    -types of those elements should be known
    -the order is important(ie the index at which element is going to be stored)
    -data is related to each other and data is in a specifc order(means order is important for tuple)
        -eg rgb,dd/mm/yyyy, hrs:minuts:seconds, 2D-Array
    NOTE-> in enums order is not important but in tupples order is important
